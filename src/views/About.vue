    <h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
    <p>
      Hi! I’m Tom, though professionally my current focus is on frontend web
      development; my skills and curiosity lie in a variety of domains from
      Neural Networks to 3D graphics. <br />I currently work as a developer at
      International Gas Detectors (IGD), a company that specialises in the
      production of gas detection solutions.<br />
      My role consists of prototyping and developing software solutions in
      diverse range of areas; from improving sensor testing and recording the
      data to developing Android and web solutions to facilitate user
      interfacing.<br />
      When I’m not at work, my curiosity often gets the better of me and I can
      be found trying to implement new project ideas as well as looking at the
      latest technologies and development practices.
